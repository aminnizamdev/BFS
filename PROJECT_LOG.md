## Development Phase Log

### Phase 1 - Core Architecture [COMPLETED]
**Timestamp:** 2024-12-19  
**Signature:** Grey  

**What:** Foundational architectural decisions  
**How:** Strategic analysis and decision-making session  
**Why:** Must establish core technical foundation before any implementation  

**Decisions Made:**
- **Consensus Mechanism:** Proof of Work (like Bitcoin)
- **Hash Function:** Blake3 (superior performance vs SHA256)
- **Digital Signatures:** Ed25519 (fastest, smallest, most practical)

**Rationale:** Blake3 provides 3-10x performance improvement over SHA256 while maintaining security. Ed25519 offers fastest verification with smallest signatures (64 bytes), aligning with our performance philosophy.

### Phase 2 - Data Layer Structures [COMPLETED]  
**Timestamp:** 2024-12-19  
**Signature:** Grey  

**What:** Implementing core data structures in Rust  
**How:** Step-by-step coding of Transaction and Block structs with serialization  
**Why:** Need concrete foundation to build upon incrementally rather than over-planning  

**Status:** FULLY IMPLEMENTED AND TESTED  

**Block Structure Finalized:**
```
Block Header:
- Block Height (essential for chain ordering)
- Parent Hash (previous block reference)  
- Merkle Root (transaction verification)
- Timestamp (UNIX epoch)
- Difficulty (PoW target)
- Nonce (PoW solution)

Transaction Structure:
- Txn ID (Blake3 hash)
- From (Ed25519 public key)
- To (recipient address)
- Amount (transfer value)
- Fee (0.001 I fixed fee for MVP)
- Nonce (replay protection)
- Timestamp (creation time)
- Signature (Ed25519 64-byte signature)
```

**Implementation Approach:** Build incrementally, test early, adjust as needed. Avoid over-architecture trap.
